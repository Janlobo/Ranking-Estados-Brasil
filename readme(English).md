# Ranking-Brazilian-States
<p> Classification of Brazilian States based on the main national indicators. Ranking of Brazilian states based on 12 indicators.</p>

# What the project does
<p> A unified view of the situation of Brazilian states based on 12 pre-determined indexes was requested.</p><br> 
<p> The dashboard should have a single page, displaying the most recent data for each index, the trends in the numbers, and their overall ranking compared to other states.</p> 
<p> In addition to ranking by indexes, it was requested to create a ranking of states in two ways:<br><br>
  . Classification of the best states with scores from 0 to 5, where 5 is the best.<br> 
  . Classification of states with the best growth trends, scored from 0 to 100.</p>
  
# Why the project is useful
<p> The dashboard was created by accessing data directly from official sources such as IPEA, IBGE, DATASUS, Ministry of Justice, etc.<br> 
  It provides an overview of the state and evaluates the governorâ€™s management during the period.</p>
  
# How users can get started with the project
<p> The dashboard was created using Power BI. To view it, you need to access the panel via the Power BI service or open it locally using Power BI Desktop.</p>
